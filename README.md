# Stackoverflow
With the increasing volume of user-generated content on Stack Overflow, efficiently categorizing questions based on their relevance and quality is essential for maintaining the platform’s usability. This project presents a comprehensive machine learning pipeline to classify Stack Overflow questions into OpenStatus categories such as "Open," "Not a real question," and "Off-topic." The dataset is sourced from the Hugging Face Datasets library and undergoes extensive preprocessing, including the removal of HTML tags, stopword filtering, and transformation using TF-IDF vectorization. Multiple machine learning models—such as Random Forest and XGBoost—are implemented and evaluated for performance based on their ability to accurately classify the questions. To enhance the understanding of textual data, a BERT-based deep learning model is fine-tuned using transfer learning techniques, significantly improving classification performance on complex queries. Furthermore, the study incorporates rich data visualizations, including word clouds, class distribution plots, and ROC curves, to provide insights into model behavior and dataset characteristics. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining traditional machine learning with modern deep learning approaches for text classification tasks. This work not only showcases the potential of AI-driven question filtering systems but also offers a scalable framework for automated moderation and quality control on community-driven platforms like Stack Overflow.
